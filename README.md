======================

Site is live at [http://ulv-codeclub.github.io/](http://ulv-codeclub.github.io/).

This is the website for the University of Laverne Code Club. It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), GitHub's built-in static site generator, to construct the site. Right now, the basic functions of the site work, and I will try to start on the design sometime soon. The current design is a placeholder.

Feel free to screw with stuff and submit pull requests if you design something neat.
