======================

This is the website for the University of Laverne Code Club. It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), GitHub's built-in static site generator, to construct the site. I'm trying to get the basic functions of the site working first, then add the design later.

Unfortunately, currently the basic functions are completely broken. Jekyll refuses to compile the thing, and I have no idea why. It's nearly impossible to find out, because I don't have Jekyll installed locally. For Windows computers, it requires like a kabillion prerequisites, like Ruby. 

I guess I should get on installing that, but I don't really feel like that right now. I'm also starting to consider the merits of using/making a static site generator in Python, which, while not built into GitHub, might end up being easier to deal with.

Gggaaaaahhhhh

Have fun.
