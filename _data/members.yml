  bio: "Hi, I'm Jacob Bogdanoff. I've been programming since I've been about 7. I started with Visual Basic 6, then switched to Python and various other programming languages. Currently, I'm best at Python, HTML+CSS, and JavaScript. When I'm not coding, I draw comics, write, and run a small web series."
