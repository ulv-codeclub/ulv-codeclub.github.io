title: About the Club
---

The Code Club was founded in February 2014 by Mumin Khan. There were numerous failed attempts at starting a Computer Science Club before, but this one is different. It aims to actually teach computer skills, not just discuss computer science.

The code club is divided into two groups:

## Hackers
The more experienced members, who could engage in larger projects and teach the less experienced members.

They are currently learning [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## Coders
The less experienced members. They are being taught how to program.

They are currently learning [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).
